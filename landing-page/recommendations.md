# Landing Page Recommendations

Here is a list of recommendations to improve the UI, security, usability, and SEO of your landing page.

## Security

- **Upgrade Dependencies:** You have already upgraded your `zod` and `@stripe/stripe-js` packages to their latest stable versions. This has patched the known security vulnerabilities.

## UI

- **Button Consistency:** Create a global button style in your `globals.css` file and apply it to all buttons. This will ensure a consistent look and feel throughout your website.

  **`globals.css`:**
  ```css
  /* ========================================================================
     Global Button Styles
     ======================================================================== */

  .btn {
    @apply inline-flex items-center justify-center px-6 py-3 border border-transparent text-base font-medium rounded-md shadow-sm text-white bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-indigo-500;
  }

  .btn-primary {
    @apply bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-indigo-600 text-white font-semibold hover:from-blue-700 hover:to-indigo-700 transition-all duration-200 shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl;
  }

  .btn-secondary {
    @apply bg-transparent border-2 border-white text-white font-semibold hover:bg-white/10 transition-colors duration-200;
  }

  .btn-tertiary {
    @apply text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 font-semibold transition-colors;
  }
  ```

- **Color Palette:** Consider adding a secondary color to create more visual interest. This could be used for things like hover states on buttons or links.

- **Typography:** Consider using a different font for headings to create more visual hierarchy.

## Usability

- **Mobile Navigation:** Consider using a more common mobile navigation pattern, such as a slide-out menu or a bottom navigation bar.

- **Accessibility:** Add `aria-label` attributes to all of your icons to improve accessibility for screen readers. For example, you could add `aria-label="Menu"` to your menu icon.

- **Hover States:** Add hover states to all of your links and buttons to provide visual feedback to the user.

## SEO

- **Image Alt Tags:** Add descriptive `alt` tags to all of your images. This will help search engines understand what your images are about and improve your image search rankings.

- **Internal Linking:** Add a few more internal links to relevant pages on your website. For example, you could link to your about page from the footer.

- **Schema Markup:** Review your schema markup to ensure that it is as complete and accurate as possible.
