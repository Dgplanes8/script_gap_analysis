## Page A — /pilot — Free 7‑Day Scripts Pilot

### What You Get (4 cards)

* 12 scripts (3 concepts × 4 variants)
* 6 storyboard thumbnails
* 1‑week test matrix (placements, budget split, kill rules)
* Mid‑week iteration on top concepts

### How It Works (3 steps)

1. **Day 0:** You send product focus + one control ad + median CTR/TSR.
2. **Day 2–3:** We deliver scripts + thumbnails.
3. **Day 5–7:** We iterate winners and send a 1‑page recap.

### Mini Proof / Samples

* Hook sample #1: “I tried \[result] in 7 days without \[common objection].” — **Why it works:** addresses time + risk.
* Hook sample #2: “POV: the 5‑minute pre‑round routine that actually lowers your score.” — **Why it works:** specific, outcome‑led.
* Hook sample #3: “The sleep routine that got me through new‑parent nights.” — **Why it works:** situational empathy.

### Eligibility

* Creator pipeline ready next 7–10 days.
* Will test 3 scripts within 7 days.
* Share TSR/CTR read; OK with anonymized testimonial.

### FAQ

* **Do you produce video?** Pilot is scripts + thumbnails; production is part of the retainer.
* **Revisions?** 2 rounds on scripts/thumbnails.
* **Research docs/prompts?** You receive a Mini Angle Map; internal tools remain in‑house.
* **Turnaround?** 48–72 business hours from brief.
* **Guarantees?** No performance guarantees; decisions anchor to brand‑median TSR/CTR at agreed spend gates.
* **Pricing after pilot?** \$1,500/mo scripts‑only or \$2,500/mo creative engine.
