# Monday Morning Marketer Landing Page PRD
## Email Capture & Conversion Optimization Focus

## 1. Project Overview

### Vision Statement
Create a high-converting landing page system for Monday Morning Marketer that maximizes email captures and conversions through strategic content placement, psychological triggers, and friction reduction across three optimized pages (/pilot, /990, /success).

### Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Email conversion rate > 30% (newsletter signup)
- **Secondary**: Calendly booking rate > 15% (pilot page)
- **Tertiary**: $990 package conversion rate > 8%

## 2. Email Capture Strategy & Target Audience

### Target Audience Profile

3. **Risk Reversal** - Free pilot + full refund removes decision friction
4. **Social Proof** - Hook samples with "why it works" explanations
5. **Urgency/Scarcity** - 72-hour delivery creates time pressure
6. **Multiple Conversion Paths** - Newsletter, pilot, $990 package
