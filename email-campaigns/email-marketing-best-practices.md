## Conversion Optimization Tactics

### 1. Segmentation Strategy
**Critical Success Factor**: Generic email sequences perform poorly

**Segmentation Criteria**:
- **Company Size**: Startup vs Enterprise messaging
- **Industry Vertical**: Specific use cases and pain points  
- **Engagement Level**: Highly engaged vs low-engagement users
- **Feature Usage**: Power users vs basic users
- **Customer Journey Stage**: Trial, onboarding, active, at-risk

### 2. Subject Line Optimization
**Best Practices**:
- Keep under 50 characters for mobile
- Use personalization beyond just name
- Create urgency without being spammy
- A/B test different approaches consistently

**High-Performing Patterns**:
- Question-based: "Still struggling with [specific problem]?"
- Benefit-focused: "Cut your [metric] by 40% in 10 minutes"
- Curiosity-driven: "The #1 mistake [target audience] makes"

### 3. Content Strategy
**Educational vs Promotional Balance**:
- **80/20 Rule**: 80% educational value, 20% promotional content
- **Value-First Approach**: Always lead with insights, tips, or solutions
- **Case Studies**: Most valuable in middle-of-funnel for B2B decision making

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Campaign Length Issues
- **Too Long**: Enterprise sales might warrant 10+ touchpoints, but simple tool trials need only 3-5 emails
- **Too Short**: Complex B2B sales need adequate nurturing time
- **Solution**: Match campaign length to sales cycle complexity

### 2. Generic Messaging
- **Problem**: One-size-fits-all content performs poorly
- **Solution**: Create distinct tracks for different segments
- **Implementation**: Minimum 3 segments (company size, use case, engagement level)

### 3. Poor Timing
- **Frequency Balance**: Avoid daily emails but don't space so far apart that you lose momentum
- **Optimal Timing**: B2B typically performs best Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm
- **Testing Required**: Every audience is different - test your specific patterns

**Test Order of Importance**:
1. **Subject Lines**: Biggest impact on open rates
2. **Send Times**: Significant impact on engagement
3. **Call-to-Action Placement**: Affects conversion rates
4. **Content Length**: Balance information vs brevity
5. **Personalization Level**: Find optimal customization

### 2. Statistical Significance
**Testing Guidelines**:
- Minimum 1,000 recipients per variant
- Run tests for full business cycle (usually 1 week)
- Achieve 95% confidence before declaring winner
- Test one variable at a time for clear results

### 3. Optimization Cycles
**Monthly Review Process**:
1. **Week 1**: Analyze previous month's performance
2. **Week 2**: Identify improvement opportunities  
3. **Week 3**: Implement tests and new campaigns
