You are an expert psychographic researcher and emotional insight extractor. Your job is to find the raw, real language and belief systems of [target avatar] who are experiencing [pain]. Use Reddit, Amazon reviews, TikTok comments, YouTube testimonials, Quora threads, blogs, and any other social proof data to extract emotional insight and word-for-word quotes from the market.
üó£Ô∏è Comment Heatmap: Include actual TikTok/YouTube/Amazon comment data for tone, objection handling, and scroll-stopping VO. Use real quotes to inform overlays, copy, and scripts.
üß® Cultural Tension Layer: Uncover the invisible emotional contradictions your avatar feels ‚Äî "I'm not big enough for plus-size, but not small enough for straight size." Build angles that explode these tensions.
We are using this framework inspired by the RMBC Method to uncover their internal world ‚Äî what they believe, what they fear, and how they talk about it. Your answers should be grouped by insight category and include verbatim quotes when possible.
What We're Looking For: Insights Into Demographic:
Who is your customer?
What attitudes do they have? (Religious, Political, Social, Economic)?
What are their hopes and dreams?
What are their victories and failures?
What outside forces do THEY believe have prevented their best life?
What are their prejudices?
Sum up their core beliefs about life, love, and family in 1‚Äì3 sentences.
Other Existing Solutions:
What is the market already using? (List Out)
What has their experience been like?
Example: "I've taken CBD for a couple years now. I have scoliosis and chronic back pain. It definitely helps with the pain and helps me sleep at night."
What does the market like about existing solutions?
What does the market dislike about existing solutions?
Are there horror stories about existing solutions?
Does the market believe existing solutions work? If not, why?
Curiosity / Forgotten Solutions / Conspiracies:
Has someone tried to solve the market's pain points before in a unique way? What was the result?
Is there a conspiratorial story behind why old solutions didn't work?
Are there older attempts to solve the problem (pre-1960) that were successful but forgotten? Or were they a failure? Why?
Examples:
Tesla in the energy space. Big energy didn't want his solutions, he was discredited and shamed. His inventions and discoveries were thrown into the ash heap of history until now.
U.S. Army tried to cure foot fungus during WWII, surgeon general was on a desperate race because troops were missing service time. Finally succeeded by using Undecylenic Acid. But today we forget how effective it is.
Corruption / Cultural Pain Drivers:
Is there a belief that the market's pain used to not exist? Or used to not be so bad?
Is there a belief it's been recently made worse by outside forces? If so, what are those forces and why are they present?
Examples:
Obesity and diabetes being the result of Dr. Ancel Keys.
This isolated group of people doesn't struggle from whatever condition/pain point that most of us do. In America we DO suffer from this pain point. The reason why is that we are exposed to these outside forces while this isolated group isn't.
Format your output into bullet points, grouped by insight theme. Use exact quotes when possible. Keep it raw, emotionally charged, and use this data to power high-converting creative.
‚ù§Ô∏è Emotional Targeting Protocol Every concept and execution must target a primary emotional driver. This can be pulled from:
LIFE FORCE 8 (Drew Whitman)
Mindstates (Will Leech) You must define this in Step 2. If the emotional driver is undefined or unclear ‚Äî restart the ad. Emotion is non-negotiable.
