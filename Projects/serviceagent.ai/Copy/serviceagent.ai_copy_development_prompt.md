## Copy Development Framework

Initial Copy (headline/hook writing).
Now that you have your research and ideation completed and banked as an expert direct response copywriter, it's not time to craft your headline if static or text hook if a video.
The headline and hook are arguably the most essential part of the ad; this is what 80% of your time should be spent on.
The headline/hook will make or break your ad. It's what the whole promise/angle/concept is built upon.
The headline/hook will also change depending on the concept you use and the formats within them. You have to be really intentional about this and clearly outline what headline/hook is for what format.
For example, a story-telling unaware hook would not fit on a static image leading to a PDP page.
As a direct-response copywriting expert, you understand that the headline/hook should be punchy but clear; you're not trying to win awards for clever copywriting. You want the target audience to be called out and immediately know the benefit/promise of the product we are advertising.
You understand that the hook needs to drive curiosity, but again, the audience needs to understand what's happening.
Also another nuance with the hook is that sometimes the audio hook to a video is different to the text hook, sometimes they are the same though. It is up to you to discern when they should or shouldn't be the same and clearly outline that in your response and work.
Remember, if we cause any confusion, the prospect will not purchase, and we will have lost the sale.
Even though you are an expert in direct response copywriting, here is a refresher on how to write good headlines and why these headlines are good (some points may be repeated from above but that is fine):
Your headline is responsible for grabbing the ATTENTION and INTEREST of members of your target market. Your headline is what causes prospects to continue reading your letter or watching your video.
The headline is the MOST important part of any marketing message. Because if you have a weak headline, it doesn't matter how compelling the rest of your sales message is. Nobody will stick around long enough to read or see it. The basic equation for a good headline is this:
Interest = Curiosity + A BIG PROMISE (Offers Strongly Desired Benefit To Reader)
This means that if you want to grab your prospect's interest, you need to trigger intense CURIOSITY. As well as promising/implying a STRONGLY desired benefit for reading or watching your sales message.
In simple terms, you need to answer the question of "What's In It" for the reader/viewer. While also positioning your core message as being NEW and UNIQUE. Because prospects today are bombarded with so many advertising messages on a daily basis. If your prospect gets the feeling of "I've heard this before", they'll leave the page before you have a chance to present your offer. So you need to DIFFERENTIATE in your headline.
For MAXIMUM CURIOSITY and INTEREST, you want your headline to make optimum usage of the following elements: SPECIFICITY (especially related to the promise and solution)
Bad Promise Example: "Lose Weight" High-Curiosity Promise Example: "Melt 23 Pounds In 5 Weeks"
Bad Solution Example: Weight Loss Secret (vague and boring) High-Curiosity Solution Example: Strange Himalayan Hormone Balancer (tells the unique origin of solution + hints at the unique mechanism of action that allows this solution to deliver desired benefit)
NEW METHODOLOGY- HOW your prospect will achieve desired results
Bad Example: Keto Diet (been heard before dozens of times) Good Example: secret 7-second Cambodian Jungle Recipe CREDIBILITY - Who made this new discovery? Examples: Multi-Millionaire Investor Examples: Harvard Scientists Examples: Top Veterinary Expert If you have credible authorities backing your headline, it increases curiosity. SOCIAL PROOF - Who is already getting results with this NEW SOLUTION? Needs to be a RELATABLE OR ASPIRATIONAL group compared to our target market.
Examples: "Used By Hollywood Celebrities" Example: "Helped 35,000+ Women Over 45"
JUXTAPOSITION/CONTRAST - Describe how the solution comes from an unexpected place
Ex: The Blood Sugar Balancing Secretâ€¦ From A Village Where People Eat Nothing But Carbsâ€¦ But Never Develop Diabetes! Ex: The Amazing "Scrap Heap" Stock-Picking Strategy Of A Former Janitorâ€¦ Who Consistently Outperforms The Wall Street Hedge Funds! CONTROVERSY/SCANDAL - We want to hint at an EXCITING, JUICY storyâ€¦ that's being kept from our reader. If certain groups don't want them to discover this information, that increases the perceived value of the solution. And maximizes our prospects' desire to know the secret. Whenever possible, we want to use our headline to present our sales message as a "newsworthy" story you likely WON'T hear on the news.
Ex: The Natural Blood Pressure Remedy That Your Cardiologist Has Been Keeping From You! Ex: The "Buried Beauty" Secret Of China's Most Desired Womanâ€¦ Protected By The Emperor's Guard For Centuries! (Erases Wrinkles & Dark Spots In As Little As 48 Hours!)
Now that you understand the elements of successful headlines, here are some examples of WINNING headlines in various niches:

âš¡ First 5 Framework: The Ad Lives or Dies Here Spend 80% of creative effort on the first 3â€“5 seconds. Every ad must:
Hook immediately with text
Deliver a promise or reason to watch
Rehook the viewer before 5s with curiosity or escalation
Eliminate all confusion
ðŸ’¥ Punch Test: All hooks/headlines must pass:
Would this stop a scroll in 0.5s?
Does it sound like a human being?
Is it emotionally resonant and benefit-specific? If not, rework using platform-native behavior and specific Golden Pain or Dream Outcome data.
REMEMBER: You'll be writing headlines for e-commerce products with the vehicle of FB/IG/TT ads, so the headlines and hooks need to be relevant and native to these platforms. Do not just blindly copy the above; think deeply and carefully about your writing.
The headlines and hooks also need to sound like a real human being said them, remember why people are using social media in the first place.
The above is to show you how you can structure your headlines and why they work, they are powerful examples and the principles still apply but remember you need headlines/hooks to be native to social media.
Here are some 'native' headlines for statics that crushed on FB & IG:
"Christmas offer ends today!". "This necklace has never been returned". "I have a pair. Get a pair. It's like when you first discover Lululemon. You want to wear them all the time". "They're the perfect pants!". "The iconic set. Effortless elegance". "Holiday collection just dropped!". "Feel good clothing for all stages of womanhood". "The most beautiful inflatable pools". "The best pool ever, it keeps the kids cool and the neighbours jealous". "Lost 30 pounds in 90 days. Period". "PCOS belly be gone". "When I started my OBVI burn I weighed 190 lbs and now 3 months later I'm now down to 156.8 lbs!". "FUPA KILLER". "Ozempic Strength in capsule form". "Mounjaro power in a capsule". "This capsule is a FUPA killer". "Feels vintage. Made new". "Overthinking is overrated. Buy the basics". "Almost vintage". "From overwhelmed to effortless". "What's the value of a discovery set?". "10 unique fragrances to choose from, which will be your favourite?". " Content warning! The value of this discovery set is too crazy to show". "Back in stock!". "This t-shirt is not cheap butâ€¦" "You'll never be undressed in premium black jeans". "Jeans you'll actually want to wear on an airplane". "Hand crafted jeans". "Jeans for 90-degree heat". "Mott & Bows viral butt-lifting jeans". "Jeans for 50-degree chills". "A figure flattering v-neck". "The magic pants". "The pants that defy the laws of nature". "The pants that defy the laws of physics". "When you do the maths, the choice is obvious". "The secret white tee's no one wants to tell you about! (incase they sell out)." "Guess My Favourite Bodysuit Brand".
Here are some native hooks (both audio and text) that absolutely crushed:
"50 year old men are going to hate this". "What would happen if a man used this every day for 3 months?". "Someone once told me they wear my pants to get a job or get laid". "The fit on these pants are absolutely impeccable". "I feel like I can get down into a squat in these". "Playing a prank on my client, GONE WRONG". "3 reasons I regret buying this viral [Product Name]". "How these pants took America by storm". "Even my husband was like what pants are those". "This is the perfect sweatshirt, it goes with literally everything". "This is Ziggy, the super cute sweatshirt we can't keep in stock". "I wanna buy more balms but they're too expensive. Can I get a discount?". "I'm 61, but I look 43 after putting beef tallow on my face every day for two weeks". "My husband is 59 but looks 40... I can't keep his transformation secret anymore." "Studies show men lose 1% of skin thickness every year after 50." "I am absolutely obsessed with these waist snatching bodysuits - I literally have them in 5 colors." "My friend told me about this shapewear. I dropped 3 sizes. I owe it all to my HeyShape Bodysuit." "Buy 1, Get 1 FREE. Wasn't Enough?". "There's absolutely no way I got a skims bodysuit dupe and it sucked my belly in so much that it made my FAVORITE JEANS TOO BIG ON ME." "The only Wallet with a lifetime warranty and here's why". "Stop Paying Extortionate Prices For These Wallets." "If you know me pretty much the only denim is wear isâ€¦". "I didn't understand why people were raving about x till I got mine". "I'm seriously obsessed with x and here's why".
Important: All hooks/headlines must follow platform-native best practices across TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram. Be intentional about matching the tone, delivery, and format. Consider the following when writing:
Platform behavior:
TikTok = raw, POV, UGC-style (e.g. "You ever just hate all your jeans... until this one?")


Facebook = clear, benefit-led (e.g. "The Only Jeans That Fit Like Yoga Pantsâ€¦ Without Looking Like Them")


Instagram Stories = bold overlay, short punchy copy (e.g. "No Gaps. No Sag. Just Fit.")


Format type: Match delivery to the format (voiceover, text, headline)


Tone calibration: Should it feel 100% native (organic content), balanced (native + DR), or direct-response heavy (ideal for retargeting)?


Action desired: ALL ADS MUST BE CONVERSION DRIVEN but you can add these little elements. Do you want the elements to include scroll stop? Comment bait? Shares? Write hooks that move toward that.


When you have done this, produce me three headline/hooks per concept/angle and clearly point out which is for what.
This should be given to me in an easy-to-read document.
Output: A document with a headline and hooks.
