## Script Framework Selection & Development

Secondary Copywriting
Now that you have the primary hooks and headlines finalized, it's time to develop the supporting copy. This varies based on format:
For Video Formats:
You need to write a complete script that builds on the hook. Choose the most appropriate script framework from the options below based on your product type, audience awareness level, and marketing objective.
SCRIPT FRAMEWORKS

### Script Framework Selection Guide When choosing which script framework to use, follow this decision tree: **Start with audience awareness level:** **If UNAWARE:** - For complex products → Use Framework #6 (Expert Authority) - For simple products → Use Framework #2 (Problem-Solution with Authority) **If PROBLEM-AWARE:** - For products with unique ingredients/formulation → Use Framework #3 (Ingredient-Focused) - For products without unique formulation: - If there's a trending angle → Use Framework #5 (Native Trend Leverager) - If not → Use Framework #7 (Comprehensive Benefits) **If SOLUTION-AWARE:** - If there's a clear transformation → Use Framework #8 (Strong Offer) - If not → Use Framework #4 (Concise Conversion) **If PRODUCT-AWARE:** - If building trust is primary objective → Use Framework #9 (Soft Sell) - If quick sale is primary objective → Use Framework #1 (Quick Product Highlight) **If MOST-AWARE:** - Use Framework #10 (Claim-Based) **Secondary factors to consider:** - Product type and complexity - Platform constraints - Competitive landscape - Brand voice requirements Select the most appropriate script framework based on: - Product type and complexity - Audience awareness level - Platform constraints - Marketing objective - Competition in the space
Select the most appropriate script framework based on:
Product type and complexity
Audience awareness level
Platform constraints
Marketing objective
Competition in the space
After selecting a framework, write a complete script following the structure while incorporating the hook from Step 3.
For Static/Image Formats:
You need to create:
Primary headline (already created in Step 3)
Supporting subheadline that elaborates on the promise
Bullet-point benefits (3-5 maximum)
CTA line
Any necessary disclaimers or urgency creators (optional)
Static Structure:
HEADLINE: [Primary headline from Step 3]

SUBHEADLINE: [1 sentence that expands the promise]

BENEFITS:
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Benefit 3]

CTA: [Clear action statement]

URGENCY: [Optional time/quantity limitation]

For Carousel Formats:
Create copy for each slide (typically 3-10 slides):
Slide 1: Hook + Problem
Slide 2-4: Solution elements/benefits (one key point per slide)
Slide 5: Proof/testimonial
Final Slide: Offer + CTA
Ensure each slide can stand alone while contributing to the overall narrative.
Voice Guidelines:
Maintain consistent voice across all copy elements
Keep secondary copy in the same tone as the headline/hook
Use the customer's language from your research
Be conversational and direct
Focus on benefits, not features
Remember to adapt the intensity of conversion elements based on funnel stage. Top-of-funnel content should be lighter on direct selling, while bottom-funnel can be more direct with offers and CTAs.
Output: Complete scripts/copy for each concept and format.
