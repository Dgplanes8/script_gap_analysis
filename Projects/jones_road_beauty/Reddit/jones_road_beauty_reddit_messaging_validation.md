- Does similar language appear naturally in discussions?
- What emotional response does this type of message generate?
- How do community members react to similar claims?
- What proof or evidence do they typically require?

### Language Authenticity Check
- Is the proposed language natural to the community?
- Would this messaging feel authentic or promotional?
- How do successful organic recommendations sound?
- What tone and style gets positive response?

### Objection Anticipation
- What pushback would this messaging likely receive?
- What questions or concerns would it raise?
- How do community members typically respond to similar claims?
- What proof points would be required for credibility?

Use Reddit data to validate and refine messaging approaches before campaign development.
